# Joke-Bot
A Discord bot that uses text commands to display jokes in a Discord text channel.

Using the command $joke, the bot will utilize the JokeAPI to generate a single line joke which will be displayed in the desired text channel

Typing the word 'haha' will generate a unique message 

By stating 'Hey Joke Bot' regardless of its capitilization, the bot will respond with a friendly reminder and will notify the user of the joke command.
